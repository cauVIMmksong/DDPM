# DDPM
it's for my Denoise Diffusion Probabilistic Model research

github make me sick..

I've run unconditional DDPM for 4days but lost the result because of the github merging and large file problem.

Run the conditional Diffusion starting from 04/21 18:26
Let's see what happens.

==============================================================================

5/1 15:50 Started Conditional DDPM training with cataract dataset from AI HUB Korea.

So far, for 100 epochs, it make pretty high resolution image of each stage of the cataract.
